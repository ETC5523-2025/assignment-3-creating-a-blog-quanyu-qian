## Hi, I’m **Quanyu Qian**.

I am currently studying for a Master of Business at Monash University, specialising in Data Analytics for Business.

My interests include working with data, building dashboards, and exploring how analytics can support better decision-making in areas such as transport and sustainability. I have experience with R, SQL, and Power BI for data analysis and visualization.

Looking ahead, I am keen to apply my analytical skills in data-driven industries, particularly in transport and sustainability, and to collaborate on innovative projects that create a positive impact.

Outside of study, I enjoy reading science fiction and experimenting with small creative projects.

Feel free to connect with me through the links below.
